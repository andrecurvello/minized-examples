# Getting started with the Avnet MiniZed

My goal is to use the Avnet MiniZed for small prototypes of hardware accelerators running on the FPGA ("processing logic" or PL) that can talk to the Arm core ("processing system" or PS). Keep that purpose in mind if you choose to follow these steps.

The MiniZed is fairly new (as of starting this repository in Oct 2017), so there is still a lack of documentation. Fortunately, you can find similar tutorials for other Zynq boards including older Avnet boards. 

Since the Zynq combines hardware and software development and MiniZed is an introductory board, I figure there must be other mere mortals like myself using it. This documentation is written humbly from that perspective. If you have tips, please contribute!

1. Follow Avnet's MiniZed tutorials 1-3. Find it at http://zedboard.org/support/design/18891/146 (Or go to http://zedboard.org/ then go to Support | Reference designs and tutorials | MiniZed).

2. At this point, you now understand how to create an HDF in Vivado using the block editor and use SDK to create and run applications. Next, get some more interesting PL to talk to the PS. For that, go to https://github.com/bmyerz/minized-examples/tree/master/dma.
