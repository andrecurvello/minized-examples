# Getting started with the Avnet MiniZed

My goal is to use the Avnet MiniZed for small prototypes of hardware accelerators running on the FPGA ("processing logic" or PL) that can talk to the Arm core ("processing system" or PS). Keep that purpose in mind if you choose to follow these steps.

The MiniZed is fairly new (as of starting this repository in Oct 2017), so there is still a limited number of targeted tutorials. Fortunately, there are lots of close-enough tutorials for other Zynq boards including older Avnet boards. 

Since the Zynq combines hardware and software development and MiniZed is an introductory board, I figure there must be other mere mortals like myself using it. This documentation is written from that perspective. If you have tips, please contribute by issuing a pull request.

If you get stuck at a certain point in these steps or the examples, [create a new issue with the Documentation label](https://github.com/bmyerz/minized-examples/issues/new).

1. __Get started with the board, Vivado, and SDK__

Follow Avnet's MiniZed tutorials 1-3. Find it at http://zedboard.org/support/design/18891/146 (Or go to http://zedboard.org/ then go to Support | Reference designs and tutorials | MiniZed).

2. __Get the PS to talk to PL with existing IP__

At this point, you now understand how to create an HDF in Vivado using the block editor and use SDK to create and run applications. Next, get some more interesting PL to talk to the PS. For that, go to https://github.com/bmyerz/minized-examples/tree/master/dma.

3. __Get the PS to talk to PL with your own IP__

At this point, you have worked with an application where the PS talks to the PL, which included an existing AXI peripheral (BRAM). A good next step is to create an application where the software talks to some custom HDL. I adapted this tutorial http://www.fpgadeveloper.com/2014/08/creating-a-custom-ip-block-in-vivado.html. Find the modifications at https://github.com/bmyerz/minized-examples/tree/master/customip.

Note that this example is quite simple in that the IP is combinational logic only (other than AXI interface). I was able to get it to work the first time on the board without verification in simulation.

4. __Verify the PS + PL in simulation__

Vivado includes a Zynq Verification IP (VIP). Basically, it will let verify your whole block design. In your testbenches you will issue PS commands to emulate what your PS would be doing. 

First, try it out using the Vivado example project (follow the video tutorial:
https://www.xilinx.com/video/soc/how-to-use-the-zynq-7000-verification-ip-verify-debug-simulation.html).

For more information on the VIP's API, see its documentation: https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/ip_documentation/processing_system7_vip/v1_0/ds940-zynq-vip.pdf. You'll see that it provides functions for issuing commands like AXI read/write and FPGA soft reset.

After trying the tutorial, you can work with your own peripheral. I suggest trying one that includes sequential logic to make it more interesting.
