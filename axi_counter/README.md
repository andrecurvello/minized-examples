In this example, we'll create an AXI peripheral IP, test in behavioral simulation everything except the AXI interface, then use it in a Zynq PS block design and test the system in behavioral.

Our AXI peripheral IP for this example is a user-resettable saturating counter. I picked this component because it is a simple sequential logic circuit that will provide both read and write interaction over AXI.

1. Create a new AXI4 peripheral IP. For sources you can add this file https://github.com/bmyerz/minized-examples/blob/master/axi_counter/axi_counter_ip_sources/Counter.v. Notice that it has an active low system reset and a user reset.

2. Add https://github.com/bmyerz/minized-examples/blob/master/axi_counter/axi_counter_ip_sources/testbench.v as a simulation source. This testbench only tests the Counter's functionality, not the AXI interface. I figure that instead of dealing with the AXI Verification IP, in the next step I'll just rely on the Zynq Verification IP that includes the AXI one.

3. Edit the \*S00_AXI.v file that Vivado generated for you to instantiate the Counter. I decided on the following register usage:

* slv_reg0: write 0x000000001 to assert user_reset, write 0x00000000 to de-assert user_reset
* slv_reg1: read to get the counter's value

4. Package the IP and close the Project

5. Create a new project. The block design should include Zynq PS. To add our Counter IP, right-click within the block diagram editor | IP Settings | IP | repositories. Navigate to the location of your IP. The default seems to be a folder inside of ip_repo/. Run connection automation. 

6. Add a simulation source. You can use this file https://github.com/bmyerz/minized-examples/blob/master/axi_counter/block_design_sources/tb.v. The testbench issues a FPGA reset, then reads the counter a couple times, then does a user reset on the counter, then reads it one more time.

7. Run behavioral simulation. The output looks something like the following (make sure you run it until completion).
